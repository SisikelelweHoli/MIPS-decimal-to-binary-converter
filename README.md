# MIPS-decimal-to-binary-converter
This project is a MIPS assembly language program that converts decimal number  into their binary representations. It serves as an educational tool to illustrate the principles of binary conversion and to provide hands-on experience with MIPS programming.

## Features

- **Decimal to Binary Conversion**: Converts any positive integer from decimal to binary.
- **Interactive User Input**: Prompts users for a decimal number and displays the corresponding binary output.
- **MIPS Assembly Code**: Demonstrates fundamental programming techniques and bitwise operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MIPS  installed on your machine.
